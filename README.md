# Convey 

## Description 

Convey is an inclusive journaling/wellness app that allows users to vent about their experiences through guided journal entries. Users are given a selection of categories and prompts to choose from with the intent to aid you in thoughtfully unpacking emotions or finding the right words to say. 


## Usage

Create, Edit, & Delete Journals 
- Each user has the ability to create an infinite amount of journals that can hold various topics of a person's choosing. 

Toggle Journals Between Public & Private
- Each user has the ability to toggle their journals between public and private. User journals that are set to public are able to be viewed by everyone in the community via the Explore page. All journals upon first creation are set to private to ensure user discretion. 

Create & Edit Entries
- Each user has the ability to create an entry, which upon selection will then cue the user to select between the categories: Social, Vent, or Self-Care. Based on the category selected, you will then be given a variety of thoughtful prompts to write about. Once you choose your topic, you're then able to fill out your entry along with your mood at the time of writing.
